# Cashvio Financial Data Encryption Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Schema Updates**

   - Updated Prisma schema for all financial data models
   - Changed numeric fields (Float/Int) to String types to store encrypted values
   - Models updated:
     - ShopBalance
     - CustomerWallet
     - Order
     - OrderItem
     - Payment
     - Item

2. **Database Migration**

   - Created and ran migration: `encrypt_financial_data`
   - All existing database tables have been updated with the new schema

3. **Data Migration**

   - Created data migration script to encrypt existing data
   - All existing financial data has been converted to encrypted strings
   - Data migration completed successfully

4. **Encryption Implementation**

   - Implemented AWS KMS encryption with local fallback
   - Added encryption/decryption methods in OrderService
   - Updated all relevant service methods to use encryption

5. **Decryption Implementation**

   - Added automatic decryption when fetching financial data
   - Implemented proper type conversion back to numeric values
   - Updated all query methods to return decrypted data

6. **Testing**

   - Created test scripts to verify encryption/decryption
   - Verified data is properly encrypted in the database
   - Confirmed API operations correctly handle encrypted data

7. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation of the encryption implementation
   - Added troubleshooting guides and security considerations
   - Documented AWS KMS configuration requirements

## Next Steps

1. **AWS KMS Configuration**

   - Set up AWS KMS keys in production environment
   - Configure environment variables:
     - AWS_REGION
     - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
     - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
     - AWS_KMS_KEY_ID or AWS_KMS_KEY_ALIAS

2. **Security Monitoring**

   - Set up CloudTrail monitoring for KMS key usage
   - Implement alerts for unusual access patterns

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor application performance with encryption enabled
   - Implement optimizations if needed

## Additional Information

The encryption implementation is complete and ready for production use. The system will continue to function even without AWS KMS configuration, using the local fallback encryption mechanism. However, for maximum security, AWS KMS should be properly configured in the production environment.

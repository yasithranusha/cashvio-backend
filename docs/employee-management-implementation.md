# Employee Management API - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- ✅ Added `Employee` model to Prisma schema with all required fields
- ✅ Created `EmployeeStatus` enum (ACTIVE, ON_LEAVE, SUSPENDED, TERMINATED)
- ✅ Added relations between Employee, User, and Shop models
- ✅ Created unique constraint on userId + shopId combination
- ✅ Added appropriate indexes for performance

### 2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
Created comprehensive DTOs in `apps/auth/src/employees/dto/employee.dto.ts`:
- ✅ `CreateEmployeeDto` - For creating new employees
- ✅ `UpdateEmployeeDto` - For updating employee information
- ✅ `GetEmployeesDto` - For querying employees with filters
- ✅ `EmployeeResponseDto` - For API responses

### 3. Service Layer
Implemented `EmployeesService` in `apps/auth/src/employees/employees.service.ts` with:
- ✅ `createEmployee()` - Create new employee records
- ✅ `getEmployees()` - Retrieve employees with pagination and filtering
- ✅ `getEmployeeById()` - Get employee by ID
- ✅ `getEmployeeByUserId()` - Get employee by user and shop
- ✅ `updateEmployee()` - Update employee information
- ✅ `deleteEmployee()` - Remove employee records
- ✅ `getShopEmployeeCount()` - Get active employee count per shop

### 4. Controller Layer
Created `EmployeesController` in `apps/auth/src/employees/employees.controller.ts` with:
- ✅ POST `/employees` - Create employee
- ✅ GET `/employees` - List employees with filters
- ✅ GET `/employees/:id` - Get employee by ID
- ✅ GET `/employees/user/:userId/shop/:shopId` - Get by user and shop
- ✅ PUT `/employees/:id` - Update employee
- ✅ DELETE `/employees/:id` - Delete employee
- ✅ GET `/employees/shop/:shopId/count` - Get employee count
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented

### 5. Module Configuration
- ✅ Created `EmployeesModule`
- ✅ Integrated with `AuthModule`
- ✅ Configured database access

### 6. Documentation
- ✅ Updated `catalog-info.yml` with employee management API endpoints
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/employee-management.md`
- ✅ Added employee management tags to Auth service

## 📋 Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Run Database Migration
Since the remote database wasn't accessible during implementation, you need to run:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/yasithranusha/Developer/NSBM/FinalYear/cashvio-backend

# Run the migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_employee_management

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

This will:
- Create the `employees` table in your database
- Add the `EmployeeStatus` enum
- Update the Prisma client with the new types

### 2. Update Environment Variables (if needed)
Ensure your `.env` file has the correct database connection:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
```

### 3. Test the API
After running the migration, test the endpoints:

```bash
# Start the auth service
yarn start:dev auth

# Test employee creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/employees \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user-uuid",
    "shopId": "shop-uuid",
    "designation": "Cashier",
    "department": "Sales",
    "salary": "30000.00",
    "hireDate": "2024-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }'

# Test retrieving employees
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/employees?shopId=shop-uuid" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### 4. Update Postman Collection
Add the employee management endpoints to your Postman collection:
- Create Employee
- Get Employees (with filters)
- Get Employee by ID
- Get Employee by User and Shop
- Update Employee
- Delete Employee
- Get Shop Employee Count

### 5. Optional: Update DTO Import
After running the migration and generating Prisma client, you can update the DTO:

In `apps/auth/src/employees/dto/employee.dto.ts`, replace:
```typescript
export enum EmployeeStatus {
  ACTIVE = 'ACTIVE',
  ON_LEAVE = 'ON_LEAVE',
  SUSPENDED = 'SUSPENDED',
  TERMINATED = 'TERMINATED',
}
```

With:
```typescript
import { EmployeeStatus } from '@prisma/client';
```

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for employees
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Advanced filtering (by shop, status, department, search)
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Data validation with class-validator
- ✅ Logging for debugging

### Security

- ✅ Role-based authorization (SHOP_OWNER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN, SHOP_STAFF)
- ✅ Input validation on all endpoints
- ✅ UUID validation for IDs

### Data Integrity

## 📊 API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Access | Description |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| POST | `/employees` | Owner, Admin | Create employee |
| GET | `/employees` | All authenticated | List employees |
| GET | `/employees/:id` | All authenticated | Get employee by ID |
| GET | `/employees/user/:userId/shop/:shopId` | All authenticated | Get by user & shop |
| PUT | `/employees/:id` | Owner, Admin | Update employee |
| DELETE | `/employees/:id` | Owner, Admin | Delete employee |
| GET | `/employees/shop/:shopId/count` | Owner, Admin | Get employee count |

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Creating Employees**: Ensure the user and shop exist before creating an employee record.
2. **Salary Handling**: Store salaries as strings (e.g., "50000.00") for precise decimal handling.
3. **Status Management**: Use appropriate status values to track employee lifecycle.
4. **Search Functionality**: The search parameter searches both name and email fields.
5. **Department Organization**: Use consistent department names across your organization.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Prisma Client**: The employee model won't be available in the Prisma client until you run the migration.
2. **Remote Database**: The migration couldn't be run automatically due to remote database configuration.
3. **Testing**: Unit tests haven't been created yet.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Consider implementing these features in future iterations:
- Employee attendance tracking
- Payroll management
- Performance reviews
- Leave request system
- Shift scheduling
- Document management
- Salary history tracking
- Employee analytics dashboard
